# Cryptocurrency APIs

Some APIs are webservices that you send or retrieve data from, usually in the JSON (javascript object notation) format, although some may use XML. Webservices expose a URL and they have a set contract, the data you send and recieve will be in a defined format, including parameters you can include in the URL itself (webservices that provide URL parameters and use the JSON data format are known as REST services). Because these URL based requests use plain text data formats, using them is programming language agnostic, you can call them from any application, whether it is running on a server (Node.js, Java , Ruby, Python or Microsoft ASP.NET using Visual Basic or C#) a native desktop or mobile app (Windows .NET applications, iPhone - Objective C, Android - Java Android SDK -- or an interpreted language that cross compiles so the same app can to run on any or all of these, such as the Javascript framework React Native) or even in a web application running entirely on the client side in Javascript (i.e. everything happens in the web browser and it doesn't need to make any calls to *our servers* which is a win in terms of security if we don't need to store any files, data or secure any server side code).

Some APIs work directly with files and that would require the code to run on our server. Some provide abstractions (also known as facades) that make it simpler, you may only need to provide a small set of necessary data and execute a single action vs making many different calls and having to execute more individual steps. Some APIs might also provide abstractions that allow you to do similar things (Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum transactions) in the exact same way, where the code to do each of these things individually in the lower level APIs is potentially vastly different. These types of APIs are provided as code that you need to include in your project, making where you are able to execute this code and the programming language you are using matter, they may provide versions of the API in multiple languages, but you must pick one of the ones they support. That being said, depending on the architecture of the application you can have multiple different modular parts to the application, where each can be written in a different language if needed. If we, for example, needed to write a part of the application to perform transactions for a specific currency using Java, we could write that code as a handful of micro services that expose REST APIs which we could then call from the rest of our application. All this being said, almost every API we potentially will need to use will likely provide a module for Node.js, which is what I prefer we write the majority of our server-side code for. All of our client-side code will be Javascript and using Node.js all of the server side code would be as well.

## 1. Bitcoin

* [Bitcoin for Developers](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-for-developers): Free - This is the full technical docs for the low level functions of Bitcoin. It's not programming language specific, it deals rather with how to create and use the files and links that bitcoin is based on. You can develop against this but you have to perform every step in the process yourself, which is quite complex, developing against a third party API makes a lot more sense unless you for some reason need this level of control (i.e. you want to run your own bitcoin banking institution). This does however provide everything you could want to know about the inner workings of the whole system, which is useful for understanding what is going on behind the scenes, especially if end up troubleshooting difficult issues or you need to do something that you can't find an API to support. It has all technical specs on transactions, contracts, wallets, payments and even mining.
* [Blockchain API](https://blockchain.info/api): Free - Supports: Node.js, Python, Java, C#, Ruby, PHP - provides the following services: payment processing (accepting a bitcoin payment), wallet service (create wallets, send/recieve between wallets), blocks and transactions (retrieve info about a block or a transaction), market data (exchange rates and statistics).
* [Coinbase API](https://developers.coinbase.com/): Transaction Fee, Bitcoin Litecoin and Etherium - Supports: Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby and PHP - The Coinbase API starts off free, they have a 1% transaction fee to transfer coin to a bank account, but this only occurs once you have converted over $1,000,000 of coins. If you convert $1,000,000+ every month you become eligible for volume discount pricing. There are additional benefits to using this API that can help to save or protect money: to protect yourself from market volatility you can enable instant exchange, coins are immediately converted into local currency and transfered into your bank account once per day. For customers paying from Coinbase wallets, they allow micro transactions of 1 satoshi (0.00000001 BTC) vs the normal Bitcoin minimum of 0.001 BTC and they also waive mining fees for Coinbase wallets. In addition to the base functionality (wallets, send/recieve money and rates/info) they also provide notifications when payments are recieved and security for storing coins.

## 2. Litecoin

* Coinbase API: see above.
* [Litecore Node](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecore-node): Free - This is a Litecoin server that runs in Node.js.  It has an extension providing additinal REST/Websocket APIs the [Insight API](https://github.com/litecoin-project/insight-lite-api)
